Although no established trails exist, backpacking is becoming increasingly popular in Gates of the Arctic, and climbers are attracted to the Arrigetch Peaks and Mount Igikpak.",AK,NPS,"7,167,192",1980aleutianIslands,Aleutian Islands Wilderness,"Stretching 1,100 miles south and west from the Alaska Peninsula, the Aleutian Islands Wilderness consists of munerous islands which are actually the peaks of submarine volcanoes rising from near sea level to more than 9,000 feet. On most of these islands you'll find lush green tundra dotted with summer wildflowers and carpeted with grasses, sedges, mosses, lichens, and heath. Cool average temperatures prevent trees from establishing here. Marine mammals include the endangered Steller sea lion, threatened northern sea otter, and harbor seal, but the Aleutians are best known for their birds. More than 10 million nest on the islands each summer. Puffins, auklets, gulls, storm petrels, cormorants, terns, kittiwakes, murres, pigeon guillemots, and murrelets are among the most abundant species. The largest known colony of northern fulmars in America--topping one-half million--nest on Chagulak Island. Half of the world's emperor geese spend their winters in the Aleutians. Once endangered with extinction, the Aleutian cackling goose is now considered recovered and continues to re-colonize former nesting islands. Nowhere else in North America can you find whooper swans, tufted ducks, Siberian ruby-throats, wood sandpipers, far eastern curlews, and black-headed gulls.",AK,FWS,"1,300,000",1980mtTimpanogos,Mount Timpanogos Wilderness,"Part of Utah's Wasatch Mountain Range, the Mount Timpanogos Wilderness offers abundant rugged terrain embellished with waterfalls and summer wildflowers. You'll find forget-me-nots, alpine buttercups, bluebells, and columbine blooming in high alpine meadows. There are also outstanding glacial cirques and moraines. Below the tree line are forests of aspen, Douglas fir, subalpine fir, limber pine, Gambel oak, maple, and chokecherry. You'll have an excellent chance of spotting Rocky Mountain goats in the Emerald Lake area, as well as mule deer, elk, and moose. In early summer the rapidly melting snow can cause dangerous high water stream crossings.",UT,FS,"10,518",1084medicineLake,Medicine Lake Wilderness,"The Medicine Lake Wilderness lies within the glacial drift prairie of northeastern Montana. The lake, for which the area is named, conserves diverse wetlands and grasslands that provide breeding grounds for migratory birds and other wildlife. It has been designated 1 of the top 100 globally important bird areas in the United States by the American Bird Conservancy. Over 126 species of birds are documented to breed in the area, including an abundance of waterfowl, grassland birds and colonial nesting birds.",MT,FWS,"11,366",1976lakeWoodruff,Lake Woodruff Wilderness,"In 1823, Major Joseph Woodruff acquired the DeLeon Springs area (the infamous Fountain of Youth) and gave his name to the nearby lake, for which the Lake Woodruff Wilderness is named. In this country of freshwater marshes, lakes, and streams, species include at least 200 birds, 42 mammals, 58 reptiles, 33 amphibians, and 68 fish. Ducks account for more than half of the migratory birds. Ospreys likewise abound, and no other wilderness echoes more often with the weird cries of the limpkin. A large portion of thearea is accessible only by boat.

His namesake, the J. N. ""Ding"" Darling Wilderness, is a mass of mangrove islands. Humidity is almost always high, and afternoon rain showers are common in the summer. Abundant wildlife species include alligators, raccoons, bobcats, river otters, marsh rabbits and migratory birds such as ospreys, brown pelicans, moorhens, ducks, herons, egrets, anhingas, wood storks, and roseate spoonbills. Visitors enjoy kayaking, canoeing, and sportfishing throughout the open water areas.
",FL,FWS,"2,619",1976beringSea,Bering Sea Wilderness,"The Saint Matthew Island Group, consisting of Saint Matthew and small nearby Hall and Pinnacle Islands, comprises the Bering Sea Wilderness. One of the largest seabird concentrations in the North Pacific (3.5 million birds) can be found here in summer, dominated by auklets, common eiders, old-squaws, gulls, murres, and puffins. A beautiful land formed by volcanic activity, these wilderness islands rise more than 1,500 feet above the sea with sheer cliffs and waterfalls dropping dramatically into icy water. On Saint Matthew you'll find one of the few colonies of northern fulmars on Earth, and almost the entire world's population of McKay's buntings nest here. Northern sea lions and seals haul out at several places, and walruses climb ashore at one spot on Saint Matthew. Gray whales are often seen offshore, and sometimes an endangered bowhead whale swims by in winter.

Bering named Cape Saint Elias four days later, on Elias' saint day, and the name was later given as well to the 18,008-foot mountain (the second highest peak in the United States) that dominates what is now the Wrangell-Saint Elias Wilderness, the largest wilderness. This is a land of remote valleys, wild rivers, and a fabulous wildlife population that includes the world's finest Dall sheep, grizzly bears, black bears, caribou, moose, bison, mountain goats, wolves, wolverines, beavers, coyotes, foxes, and marmots. In the north the glaciated peaks drop to tundra and boreal forested uplands. In the south massive glaciers spread from the mountains almost to the Gulf of Alaska.

The Ka'u Desert Trail curls across shadeless lava fields past cinder cones; The Ka'aha Trail leads hikers down the fault scarps of Hilina Pali to the ocean; The Napau Trail crosses lava from the Mauna Ulu Lava Shield and follows above the path of magma flowing to the vent on Kilauea's east rift.,HI,NPS,"130,790",1978petrifiedForest,Petrified Forest National Wilderness,"About 225 million years ago the Petrified Forest National Wilderness Area was a vast floodplain crossed by many streams. Tall, stately, pinelike trees grew here, sheltering a myriad of reptiles. When the trees fell, they washed into the water to be buried under silt, mud, and volcanic ash. Groundwater seeped through the logs, bearing silica that later crystallized into quartz, which ultimately petrified the wood. After centuries of burial and upheaval, the land became the high, dry Arizona tableland seen today. While the forces of erosion sculpted the Painted Desert, they also brought the petrified wood slowly to the surface. In addition to the petrified wood logs, visitors can observe remnants of petro-glyphs and stone houses built by early human settlers to this region, dating back approximately 2,000 years.",AZ,NPS,"50,260",1970hatfield,Mark O Hatfield Wilderness,"This wilderness, named for a long-time former Oregon Senator, the Mark O. Hatfield Wilderness lies just south of the sheer cliffs of the Columbia River Gorge. The breaks of the gorge are spectacular basalt cliffs, rocky slopes, and rock outcroppings. Rugged and steep, the slopes of the wilderness rise to a slightly uneven plateau and on to mountain peaks, talus slopes, and lakes with elevations ranging from approximately 100 feet near the river to 4,900 feet on Mount Defiance. Sparkling waterfalls and mossy-green cliff faces often highlight the deep drainages slashing through the broad, flat ridge tops. The main waterways--Herman Creek, Eagle Creek, and Tanner Creek--flow north toward the river, supporting borders of western hemlock and fir. Most of the 200 miles of trails follow drainages. Approximately 14 miles of the Pacific Crest Trail and the Eagle Creek Trail receive the most use.",OR,FS,"65,822",1984sacatar,Sacatar Trail Wilderness,"The Sacatar Trail, an old wagon road for which this wilderness is named, is one of the few reminders that humans ever traveled regularly through this area. It provides relatively easy access into this rugged wilderness on the eastern slope of the southern Sierra Nevada Mountains. Valleys, canyons, and alluvial fans rise into steep hills that eventually peak along ridge tops and granite summits with elevations of more than 7,800 feet. Creosote bush, Joshua trees, and desert shrubs in the lower elevations change to scattered pi&ntilde;on and juniper woodlands dotted with cactuses higher up. In several of the canyons, you'll find springs that feed riparian habitats of cottonwoods, willows, and grasses.

The 134 degrees recorded on July 10, 1913 is the highest temperature recorded on the planet. Though broken up by paved and dirt roads into at least 40 smaller wilderness sections, it is the the largest named wilderness in the lower 48 states. Annual rainfall measures slightly less than two inches, yet there is far more to Death Valley than dry heat. Telescope Peak rises to 11,049 feet, and much of the Panamint Range stands white under winter snow. Contrast this with nearby Badwater, 15 or so miles to the east as the crow flies, where the earth lies almost 300 feet below sea level, the lowest terrestrial point in the North America. Vast fields of sand dunes shimmer in the sun, and rock outcroppings are carved into shapes of staggering beauty, especially striking at dawn and dusk. Colorful cliffs stand above endless flats of creosote bush. More than 1000 species of plants have been identified within the park, and nights come alive to the scurrying of small mammals. Coyotes, gray and kit foxes, bobcats, jackrabbits, and desert tortoises thrive here, as do a plethora of bats, birds, lizards, and snakes. Desert bighorn sheep live in the canyons and lower mountains while mule deer live in the high Panamints, where you can sometimes tramp through a dry forest of pi&ntilde;on, juniper, mountain mahogany, and a few bristlecone pines. Wildflowers bloom in spectacular variety when enough rain falls during the winter and spring.

Serving as the headwaters for the mighty Green River, this wilderness holds 7 of the 10 largest glaciers in the lower 48, more than 2,300 cold crystalline lakes and ponds, and numerous glacier-carved cirques, kettles, valleys, and hanging troughs. Gannett Peak, located on the shared boundary of the Fitzpatrick Wilderness, is the highest point in Wyoming at 13,804 feet, towering above a vast area of stark granite summits that were once thrust violently into the sky by enormous compressional forces within the earth.",WY,FS,"428,087",1964pemigewasset,Pemigewasset Wilderness,"Nary a road blemishes New Hampshire's largest Wilderness, a bastion of hardwoods further insulated by a series of raggedly beautiful peaks that extend beyond the tree line and drain in-to the East Branch of the Pemigewasset River. If you make it past these welcome obstacles, prepare to enjoy New England backpacking at its best. The ""Pemi"" is so secluded, in fact, that I've run across many a moose, deer, even a fox and a black bear. Loggers removed almost the entire forest cover between 1890 and 1940, but 55 years of regeneration have eliminated virtually all signs of that era. 
The sharp, narrow Franconia Range and Twin Range form a horseshoe around the western portion of the Pemigewasset Wilderness, with the Franconia threatening to challenge the Presidential Range for the title of Premier Peak. Mount Bond's crags and ledges demarcate the central northern boundary, and the Bondcliffs, just southwest of Mount Bond, quietly flaunt a vista across mountains and forests that show no trace of human interference. This is one of the few places in New Hampshire that can confess to boasting such a flawless view. The wilderness flattens in the eastern portion, an area sometimes referred to as the Desolation Region for having withstood devastating logging operations. But despite the bad rap, the Desolation Region contains lovely Thoreau Falls, Ethan Pond, and Shoal Pond.
