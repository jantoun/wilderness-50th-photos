Tall, stately, pinelike trees grew here, sheltering a myriad of reptiles. When the trees fell, they washed into the water to be buried under silt, mud, and volcanic ash. Groundwater seeped through the logs, bearing silica that later crystallized into quartz, which ultimately petrified the wood. After centuries of burial and upheaval, the land became the high, dry Arizona tableland seen today. While the forces of erosion sculpted the Painted Desert, they also brought the petrified wood slowly to the surface. In addition to the petrified wood logs, visitors can observe remnants of petro-glyphs and stone houses built by early human settlers to this region, dating back approximately 2,000 years.","state":"AZ","agency":"NPS","acreage":"50,260","yearOriginallyDesignated":"1970"},{"wilderness":"hatfield","wildernessName":"Mark O Hatfield Wilderness","description":"This wilderness, named for a long-time former Oregon Senator, the Mark O. Hatfield Wilderness lies just south of the sheer cliffs of the Columbia River Gorge. The breaks of the gorge are spectacular basalt cliffs, rocky slopes, and rock outcroppings. Rugged and steep, the slopes of the wilderness rise to a slightly uneven plateau and on to mountain peaks, talus slopes, and lakes with elevations ranging from approximately 100 feet near the river to 4,900 feet on Mount Defiance. Sparkling waterfalls and mossy-green cliff faces often highlight the deep drainages slashing through the broad, flat ridge tops. The main waterways--Herman Creek, Eagle Creek, and Tanner Creek--flow north toward the river, supporting borders of western hemlock and fir. Most of the 200 miles of trails follow drainages. Approximately 14 miles of the Pacific Crest Trail and the Eagle Creek Trail receive the most use.","state":"OR","agency":"FS","acreage":"65,822","yearOriginallyDesignated":"1984"},{"wilderness":"sacatar","wildernessName":"Sacatar Trail Wilderness","description":"The Sacatar Trail, an old wagon road for which this wilderness is named, is one of the few reminders that humans ever traveled regularly through this area. It provides relatively easy access into this rugged wilderness on the eastern slope of the southern Sierra Nevada Mountains. Valleys, canyons, and alluvial fans rise into steep hills that eventually peak along ridge tops and granite summits with elevations of more than 7,800 feet. Creosote bush, Joshua trees, and desert shrubs in the lower elevations change to scattered pi&ntilde;on and juniper woodlands dotted with cactuses higher up. In several of the canyons, you'll find springs that feed riparian habitats of cottonwoods, willows, and grasses. Mule deer flourish, along with golden eagles, prairie falcons, and other raptors, as well as game birds such as quail and dove.","state":"CA","agency":"BLM","acreage":"50,451","yearOriginallyDesignated":"1994"},{"wilderness":"mtJefferson","wildernessName":"Mount Jefferson Wilderness","description":"Five glaciers mantle the slopes of stately Mount Jefferson, the dominant feature in this region of the high Cascades and the landmark for which this wilderness is named. At 10,497 feet, Mount Jefferson challenges hikers with the steepest, most difficult climb of Oregon's high summits. The southern portion of the area rests beneath 7,841-foot Three Fingered Jack. Most of the high country of this wilderness is wide open with scattered tree cover, long talus slopes, rocky outcroppings, alpine meadows, and year-round patches of snow. Between 5,000 feet and 6,000 feet you'll find more than 150 small lakes, about half of them stocked with trout. A grand forest of Douglas fir, silver fir, subalpine fir, mountain hemlock, lodgepole pine, ponderosa pine, and cedar mix with vine maple, huckleberry, and rhododendron to distinguish the lower elevations.","state":"OR","agency":"FS","acreage":"104,523","yearOriginallyDesignated":"1968"},{"wilderness":"deathValley","wildernessName":"Death Valley Wilderness","description":"The Death Valley Wilderness is the hottest, driest, lowest spot in North America. The 134 degrees recorded on July 10, 1913 is the highest temperature recorded on the planet. Though broken up by paved and dirt roads into at least 40 smaller wilderness sections, it is the the largest named wilderness in the lower 48 states. Annual rainfall measures slightly less than two inches, yet there is far more to Death Valley than dry heat. Telescope Peak rises to 11,049 feet, and much of the Panamint Range stands white under winter snow. Contrast this with nearby Badwater, 15 or so miles to the east as the crow flies, where the earth lies almost 300 feet below sea level, the lowest terrestrial point in the North America. Vast fields of sand dunes shimmer in the sun, and rock outcroppings are carved into shapes of staggering beauty, especially striking at dawn and dusk. Colorful cliffs stand above endless flats of creosote bush. More than 1000 species of plants have been identified within the park, and nights come alive to the scurrying of small mammals. Coyotes, gray and kit foxes, bobcats, jackrabbits, and desert tortoises thrive here, as do a plethora of bats, birds, lizards, and snakes. Desert bighorn sheep live in the canyons and lower mountains while mule deer live in the high Panamints, where you can sometimes tramp through a dry forest of pi&ntilde;on, juniper, mountain mahogany, and a few bristlecone pines. Wildflowers bloom in spectacular variety when enough rain falls during the winter and spring. Ubehebe Crater opens 2,400 feet in diameter, marking where a \"maar\" volcano erupted less than 500 years ago.

This rugged piece of the Rocky Mountains, extending for approximately 80 miles along the western slope of the Continental Divide, contains a unique combination of jagged granite rock, alpine forest, and open alpine meadows. Serving as the headwaters for the mighty Green River, this wilderness holds 7 of the 10 largest glaciers in the lower 48, more than 2,300 cold crystalline lakes and ponds, and numerous glacier-carved cirques, kettles, valleys, and hanging troughs. Gannett Peak, located on the shared boundary of the Fitzpatrick Wilderness, is the highest point in Wyoming at 13,804 feet, towering above a vast area of stark granite summits that were once thrust violently into the sky by enormous compressional forces within the earth.","state":"WY","agency":"FS","acreage":"428,087","yearOriginallyDesignated":"1964"},{"wilderness":"pemigewasset","wildernessName":"Pemigewasset Wilderness","description":"Nary a road blemishes New Hampshire's largest Wilderness, a bastion of hardwoods further insulated by a series of raggedly beautiful peaks that extend beyond the tree line and drain in-to the East Branch of the Pemigewasset River. If you make it past these welcome obstacles, prepare to enjoy New England backpacking at its best. The \"Pemi\" is so secluded, in fact, that I've run across many a moose, deer, even a fox and a black bear. Loggers removed almost the entire forest cover between 1890 and 1940, but 55 years of regeneration have eliminated virtually all signs of that era. \nThe sharp, narrow Franconia Range and Twin Range form a horseshoe around the western portion of the Pemigewasset Wilderness, with the Franconia threatening to challenge the Presidential Range for the title of Premier Peak. Mount Bond's crags and ledges demarcate the central northern boundary, and the Bondcliffs, just southwest of Mount Bond, quietly flaunt a vista across mountains and forests that show no trace of human interference. This is one of the few places in New Hampshire that can confess to boasting such a flawless view. The wilderness flattens in the eastern portion, an area sometimes referred to as the Desolation Region for having withstood devastating logging operations. But despite the bad rap, the Desolation Region contains lovely Thoreau Falls, Ethan Pond, and Shoal Pond.
